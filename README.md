# Car-Price-Prediction
Python ML model estimating car prices based on features. Dataset preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, model development, and evaluation. Valuable insights for automotive, online marketplaces, and insurance. 

Description:
This project focuses on developing a car price prediction model using machine learning in Python. The goal is to create an accurate model that can estimate car prices based on their features.

The project involves essential steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model development, and evaluation. The dataset is carefully cleaned and prepared, ensuring missing values and outliers are handled appropriately. Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to gain insights and understand the relationships between car features and prices.

Using machine learning algorithms, a predictive model is trained on the dataset. The model is optimized by selecting relevant features and tuning hyperparameters to improve performance. Evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) are used to assess the accuracy of the model.

The developed car price prediction model has various practical applications, including the automotive industry, online car marketplaces, and insurance companies. It provides valuable insights into the factors influencing car prices and supports informed decision-making for buying, selling, and valuing cars.

The project code and documentation are available on GitHub, providing a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in implementing car price prediction using machine learning in Python. The code is well-documented for easy understanding and reproducibility.

By sharing this project on GitHub, it aims to contribute to the data science and machine learning community, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among enthusiasts and professionals in the field.
